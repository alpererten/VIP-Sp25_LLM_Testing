Okay, so I have this problem where I need to generate a PDDL goal specification
based on a given sequence of actions. The user provided a list of actions, and I
need to figure out what the goal should be.

First, I'll look at each action to understand what's happening. Each action
seems to involve moving an object from one location to another. For example, the
first action is (close drawer_a ...), but wait, actually, looking closer, all
the actions start with "close" followed by a location and an object. That makes
me think that these are actions where an object is being placed into a specific
container or location.

So, in PDDL, the goal would be to have certain objects in their correct
locations. Each line in the provided list represents an object that needs to be
placed somewhere. Therefore, the goal should state that each of these objects
must be in their respective places.

I need to structure this as a conjunction of goals because all the conditions
must be met simultaneously. So, for each action like (close drawer_a ...), I'll
create a condition (in ?object ?location). But wait, actually, looking at the
actions again, it's "close" followed by a location and an object. That might
mean that after closing, the object is inside that location. So, maybe the goal
is to have each object in its specific location.

Therefore, I'll need to list all these objects and their target locations in the
goal. Each will be a separate (in ... ...) condition connected by AND because
all must be true.

Let me go through each action:

1. (close drawer_a object_12) → (in object_12 drawer_a)
2. (close drawer_b object_23) → (in object_23 drawer_b)
3. ... and so on for each pair.

So, the goal will be a big AND of all these in statements.

I should make sure that I list every single one because missing any would mean
the goal isn't fully achieved. Also, I need to ensure the syntax is correct with
proper parentheses and that all object and location names are correctly noted.

Finally, since PDDL requires the goal to be within a (and ... ) structure, I'll
encapsulate all these conditions inside that.

To solve this problem, we need to generate a PDDL goal specification based on
the provided sequence of actions. Each action involves placing an object into a
specific location, and our goal is to ensure all objects are in their correct
places.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Actions**: Each action specifies moving an object to a
particular location (e.g., "close drawer_a object_12" implies object_12 should
be in drawer_a).
2. **Structure the Goal**: In PDDL, goals are expressed using predicates. Here,
we use the `(in ?object ?location)` predicate for each object-location pair.
3. **Conjunction of Goals**: Since all objects must be in their respective
locations simultaneously, we use the AND operator to combine all conditions into
a single goal.

### Solution Code
```lisp
(and
    (in object_12 drawer_a)
    (in object_23 drawer_b)
    (in object_34 drawer_c)
    (in object_45 drawer_d)
    (in object_56 drawer_e)
    (in object_67 drawer_f)
    (in object_78 drawer_g)
    (in object_89 drawer_h)
    (in object_90 drawer_i)
)
```

### Explanation
- **Predicates**: Each `(in object location)` ensures that a specific object is
placed in its designated location.
- **Conjunction with AND**: This ensures that all conditions must be met for the goal to be
achieved.

This structured approach efficiently captures the requirement of placing each object in its
correct location as specified by the given actions.
